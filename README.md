# hello-world
My first repository used to learn GitHub.

Editing this file in another branch called readme-edits.

Now editing in the base branch.

I am a test manager who is broadening her knowledge by learning Git and GitHub. Maybe one day when I 
retire or even before I will get back to my coding days and contribute to an interesting project.
